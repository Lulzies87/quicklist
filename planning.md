# Project sharing app
Users can create a project, which would be public, and included with a price the the project's
creator would like to pay for it
Other users can go to other people's projects, do them for them, and earn the amount that the
creator set for said project.

After you deliver a job for the project's creator, if he likes what you delivered,
he can mark you as:
* Very good = 10 points
* Good = 5 points
* Neutral = 3 points
* Bad = -5 points
* Very bad = 10 points
